# This configuration file demonstrates how users can explicitly allow to 'pass-through' request
# for given URI. In combination with restrictive 'catch all' rules it can help to build
# 'whitelists'.
#
# In given example only "/foo" endpoint is allowed to be non-protected (no OAuth2 tokens required).
